    Arguments
    ---------

    input2DPower - ndarray containing 2D power spectrum of a map. It need not already have been
                   downsampled to the shape of the stamp cutout
    inputLy
    inputLx      - the fourier wavenumbers corresponding to the y and x axes of the stamp cutout
    stampArc     - the width in arcminutes of the stamp cut out
    stampPxX      - the pixel width in arcminutes of the stamp cut out in the x direction
    stampPxY      - the pixel width in arcminutes of the stamp cut out in the y direction
    holeArc      - the radius of the circular hole in arcminutes
    bufferFactor - the pixel covariance matrix will be calculated on a periodic stamp larger by this
                   factor
    verbose      - True if you want more commentary

    Returns
    -------

    meanMul      - a matrix that has shape (nh,nc) where nh is the number of pixels in the hole and
                   nc is the number of pixels outside (in the "context"). It should be multiplied
                   by a vector (nc) containing pixels outside to get a vector (nh) for the mean
                   value of the pixels inside
    covRoot      - a (nh,nh) sqrt(covariance matrix) that can be used to generate a random realization
                   in the hole. This can be generated by multiplying the sqrt of cov by a vector (nh)
                   of standard normal variables. The generated vector should be added to the mean value
                   obtained using meanMul
    pcov         - the pixel-pixel covariance matrix used in intermediate steps, if you want to re-use it
    targetTemplate - a liteMap template of the stamp cutout
    m1           - a boolean array that can be used to select the hole region
    m2           - a boolean array that can be used to select the context region
